## General Info

**Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11**

**About:** supperJio is a food delivery consolidation webapp that aims to connect hungry people in your vicinity to reduce delivery costs and carbon footprint

**Problem Identification & Motivation:** 
After surviving a hard day's work, you finally get home to complete your remaining assignments and prepare for tomorrow. You suddenly experience a boba craving, yet hefty delivery charges force you to subdue it.

Despite living in a densely populated city, many of us are unable to find nearby friends or neighbours to share delivery costs and satisfy our late-night cravings. Imagine having a platform connecting nearby residents to order food together. Not only do consumers save on delivery charges, but the carbon footprint will also be reduced as fewer trips are made by delivery riders in the vicinity.
